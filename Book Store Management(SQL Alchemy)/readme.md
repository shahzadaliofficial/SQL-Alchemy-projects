2. **Authors**: Details of authors who write the books.
3. **Customers**: Details of customers who purchase books.
4. **Orders**: Information about book orders, including which customer placed the order, the books in the order, and the total amount.

### **Entities and Relationships**

1. **Tables**:

   * `Authors`: Information about authors.
   * `Books`: Details about books.
   * `Customers`: Customer details.
   * `Orders`: Orders placed by customers.
   * `OrderItems`: Mapping table for many-to-many relationship between `Orders` and `Books`.

2. **Relationships**:

   * An author can write many books (One-to-Many).
   * A book can appear in many orders, and an order can include many books (Many-to-Many).
   * A customer can place many orders (One-to-Many).
